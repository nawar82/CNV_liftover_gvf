Liftover CNV VCF Files from hg38 to hg19 and Convert to GVF

This script automates the liftover process for Copy Number Variation (CNV) VCF files generated
by GATK gCNV, converting their genomic coordinates from hg38 to hg19. It also transforms the
VCF data into GVF format.

### Features:
- Reads a list of VCF file paths from an input text file.
- Performs liftover of CNV regions using the UCSC liftOver tool.
- Updates CNV IDs and the INFO field (`END` attribute) to reflect hg19 coordinates.
- Generates output files automatically with `_hg19.vcf` and `_hg19.gvf` suffixes.
- Skips missing files and provides warnings.

### Dependencies:
- Python libraries: `vcfpy`, `argparse`, `subprocess`
- External tools: UCSC `liftOver`
- Required files:
    - UCSC chain file for hg38 to hg19 conversion (`hg38ToHg19.over.chain.gz`)
    - Valid CNV VCF files in hg38 format generated by gCNV tool

### Usage:
1. Prepare a text file (e.g., `file_list.txt`) listing the paths to VCF files, one per line:
2. Run the script:
```bash
python Liftover_and_gvf.py -i file_list.txt
