Liftover CNV VCF Files from hg38 to hg19 and Convert to GVF

This script automates the processing of Copy Number Variation (CNV) VCF files generated
by GATK gCNV. It can optionally perform liftover from hg38 to hg19 and convert
the VCF data into GVF format.

### Features:
- Reads a list of VCF file paths from an input text file.
- Optionally performs liftover of CNV regions using the UCSC liftOver tool.
- Updates CNV IDs and the INFO field (`END` attribute) to reflect hg19 coordinates.
- Generates output files with `_hg19.gvf` suffix.
- Skips missing files and provides warnings.
- Applies CN filtering rules only to `chrX`, depending on the sample's sex:
  - **Males (`chrX`)**:
    - CN == 1 variants are skipped.
    - CN == 0 is classified as `DEL`.
    - CN â‰¥ 2 is classified as `DUP`.
  - **Females (`chrX`)**:
    - CN == 2 variants are skipped.

### Dependencies:
- Python libraries: `vcfpy`, `argparse`, `subprocess`
- External tools: UCSC `liftOver` (if liftover is enabled)
- Required files:
    - UCSC chain file for hg38 to hg19 conversion (`hg38ToHg19.over.chain.gz`)
    - Valid CNV VCF files generated by gCNV tool

### Usage:
1. Prepare a text file (e.g., `file_list.txt`) listing the paths to VCF files, one per line.
2. Run the script with liftover enabled (default):
```bash
python Liftover_and_gvf.py -i file_list.txt
```
3. Run the script without liftover (for hg19 VCFs):
```bash
python Liftover_and_gvf.py -i file_list.txt --no-liftover
```
